I'm a PhD student in Biology at the University of Victoria (Dr. Francis Juanes) and Pacific Salmon Foundation (Dr. Isobel Pearsall, Dr. Will Duguid). My PhD is part of the [Bottlenecks to Survival Project](https://www.survivalbottlenecks.ca/), co-led by Pacific Salmon Foundation and British Columbia Conservation Foundation. My research goal is to identify where, when, and why salmon move between different ocean regions, using acoustic telemetry.

I teach workshops on using R for spatial data. These workshops equip participants to make a wide range of maps, from classic study area maps to animated maps of animal movements (example below). This website contains code and tutorials to help you communicate your science with maps.
