I'm a PhD student in Biology at the University of Victoria, supervised by Francis Juanes. My PhD is part of the [Bottlenecks to Survival Project](https://www.survivalbottlenecks.ca/), co-led by Pacific Salmon Foundation and British Columbia Conservation Foundation.

My research goal is to identify where, when, and why salmon move between different ocean regions, using acoustic telemetry. With my labmates, we also use stomach contents to understand how these regions present salmon with distinct foraging opportunities.

I teach workshops on using R for spatial data. This website contains code and tutorials to help you communicate your science with maps.
